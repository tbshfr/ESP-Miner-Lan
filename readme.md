# ESP-Miner-Lan
This is a fork of esp-miner, the open source ESP32 firmware for the [Bitaxe](https://github.com/bitaxeorg/bitaxe) with ethernet support.    
The idea and much of the code come from [CryptoIceMLH/ESP-Miner-LAN](https://github.com/CryptoIceMLH/ESP-Miner-LAN). This aims to be a more maintainable version of the Ethernet implementation.

> :warning: This was only tested on a Bitaxe 601. The Author takes NO responsibility. Use this at your OWN RISK!

You can find the wiring instructions [here](ethernet-wiring.md).

# Bitaxetool
We also have a command line python tool for flashing Bitaxe and updating the config called Bitaxetool 

**Bitaxetool Requires Python3.4 or later and pip**

Install bitaxetool from pip. pip is included with Python 3.4 but if you need to install it check <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>

```
pip install --upgrade bitaxetool
```
The bitaxetool includes all necessary library for flashing the binaries to the Bitaxe Hardware.

**Notes**
 - The bitaxetool does not work properly with esptool v5.x.x, esptool v4.9.0 or earlier is required.
 - Bitaxetool v0.6.1 - locked to using esptool v4.9.0

```
pip install bitaxetool==0.6.1
```

- Flash a "factory" image to a Bitaxe to reset to factory settings. Make sure to choose an image built for your hardware version (401) in this case:

```
bitaxetool --firmware ./esp-miner-factory-401-v2.4.2.bin
```
- Flash just the NVS config to a bitaxe:

```
bitaxetool --config ./configs/config-401.csv
```
- Flash both a factory image _and_ a config to your Bitaxe: note the settings in the config file will overwrite the config already baked into the factory image:

```
bitaxetool --config ./configs/config-401.csv --firmware ./esp-miner-factory-401-v2.4.2.bin
```

## AxeOS API
The esp-miner UI is called AxeOS and provides an API to expose actions and information.

## mDNS Support

ESP-Miner now includes comprehensive mDNS (multicast DNS) support for seamless network discovery and device accessibility. This feature enables automatic device discovery on local networks without requiring manual IP address configuration.

### Features

- **Automatic mDNS Initialization**: Device automatically registers with mDNS/Bonjour/Avahi services on network connection
- **Dynamic Hostname Registration**: Device hostname is registered as `<hostname>.local` (e.g., `bitaxe.local`)
- **Service Advertisement**: HTTP service is advertised as `_http._tcp` on port 80
- **AxeOS Subtype**: Advertises `_axeos._sub._http._tcp` for targeted DNS-SD discovery of AxeOS devices
- **Device TXT Records**: Includes board version, family, ASIC model, ASIC count, and firmware version as DNS-SD TXT records
- **Dynamic Hostname Updates**: mDNS hostname updates automatically when device hostname is changed via web interface
- **Hostname Normalization**: Automatically strips `.local` suffix when setting hostnames to prevent duplicate registrations
- **CORS Support**: Enhanced CORS handling to allow requests from mDNS hostnames
- **Hostname Conflict Resolution**: Automatically detects and resolves hostname conflicts by appending MAC address suffix when needed
- **Enhanced Swarm Discovery**: Swarm mode supports both IP addresses and .local hostnames for seamless network management

### Network Discovery

Once connected to your local network, the device becomes discoverable through:

```bash
# Using avahi-browse (Linux)
avahi-browse _http._tcp

# Discover AxeOS devices specifically
avahi-browse _axeos._sub._http._tcp

# Using dns-sd (macOS)
dns-sd -B _http._tcp

# Discover AxeOS devices with TXT records
dns-sd -B _axeos._sub._http._tcp

# Direct access
http://<hostname>.local
```

### Configuration

- **Default Hostname**: `bitaxe` (configurable via web interface)
- **Service Type**: `_http._tcp`
- **Subtype**: `_axeos._sub._http._tcp`
- **Port**: `80`
- **Instance Name**: `Bitaxe <family> <board> (<mac_suffix>)` (e.g., `Bitaxe Gamma 601 (A1B2)`)
- **TXT Records**: `board`, `family`, `asic`, `asic_count`, `fw_version`

### Hostname Conflict Resolution

If multiple devices attempt to use the same hostname, ESP-Miner automatically resolves conflicts by appending a MAC address-derived suffix (e.g., `bitaxe-12ab` if `bitaxe` is taken). This ensures unique network identification without manual intervention.

### Benefits

- **Zero-Configuration Discovery**: Devices automatically appear in network browsers
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works with Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices
- **No IP Address Required**: Access devices using human-readable names
- **Automatic Resolution**: DNS resolution happens transparently in the background
- **Zero-Configuration Swarm Management**: Automatic device discovery and management without IP configuration
- **Enhanced Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Improved support across different network environments and discovery protocols

## Administration

The firmware hosts a small web server on port 80 for administrative purposes. Once the Bitaxe device is connected to the local network, the admin web front end may be accessed via a web browser connected to the same network at `http://<IP>`, replacing `IP` with the LAN IP address of the Bitaxe device, or `http://bitaxe`, provided your network supports mDNS configuration.

### Recovery

In the event that the admin web front end is inaccessible, for example because of an unsuccessful custom Web UI update, a recovery page can be accessed at `http://<IP>/recovery`.

### Unlock Settings

In order to unlock the Input fields for ASIC Frequency and ASIC Core Voltage you need to append `?oc` to the end of the settings tab URL in your browser. Be aware that without additional cooling overclocking can overheat and/or damage your Bitaxe.

## Unified Firmware & Rollbacks

Starting with the unified firmware releases, ESP-Miner uses a unified architecture where the AxeOS frontend is compiled, gzipped, and embedded directly into the firmware application binary (`esp-miner.bin`). 

A separate Web UI image (`www.bin`) is no longer required for standard usage since the web interface is served directly from the firmware. If you want to use a custom or modified AxeOS frontend, you can still enable the **custom web UI** option in the settings. This allows you to upload and serve a separate `www.bin` from the SPIFFS partition, which takes priority over the built-in assets.

### Disabling Custom Web UI via Recovery Page or API

If a device is stuck serving an older custom `www.bin` partition and the Web UI settings option is not accessible, you can disable custom WWW and revert to the embedded AxeOS interface by visiting the recovery page in your browser:

```
http://<IP>/recovery
```

Alternatively, you can disable `useCustomWWW` directly via the REST API:

```bash
# Disable custom Web UI (revert to embedded AxeOS)
curl -X PATCH http://YOUR-BITAXE-IP/api/system \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"useCustomWWW": 0}'

# Restart the device to apply changes
curl -X POST http://YOUR-BITAXE-IP/api/system/restart
```

### Rollback to Pre-Unified Firmware

If you roll back the firmware from a unified version to an older, pre-unified version (which expects a separate web partition):

- **www partition persistence**: The `www` (SPIFFS) partition on the flash chip will remain untouched during the rollback, keeping whatever latest non-unified Web UI version was last active on the device.
- **Potential UI Version Mismatch**: Since older firmware relies entirely on the separate `www` partition to serve the web interface, the device will load whatever files exist in that partition. If you experience layout errors or missing features after rolling back, you will need to manually flash or upload a compatible `www.bin` version that matches the older firmware version.

## Development using esp-miner/devcontainer

This configuration allows you to edit locally and compile the source code using a docker container so you don't have to install the ESP-IDF toolchain and other supporting software on your computer to compile the firmware.

### Prerequisites

- Docker server

### Local PC Setup

These instructions will assume an installation to your home directory.
```
cd ~
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bitaxeorg/ESP-MINER.git
cd ESP-MINER
git checkout <the branch you want>
git submodule update --init --recursive
# The next step builds the docker container that will compile the source code
# This will take several minutes to finish
docker build -t espminer-build .devcontainer
```
### Building

```
cd ~/ESP-MINER
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/workspace espminer-build /bin/bash
git config --global --add safe.directory /workspace    # set git permissions or build will fail; only done once
cd /workspace
idf.py build
```	
Once the build is done exit out of the docker session and flash the new firmware.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Install the ESP-IDF toolchain from https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/
- Install nodejs/npm from https://nodejs.org/en/download
- (Optional) Install the ESP-IDF extension for VSCode from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=espressif.esp-idf-extension

### Cloning

This project uses git submodules (e.g. libsecp256k1). Clone with `--recursive`:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bitaxeorg/ESP-Miner.git
```

If you already have a checkout, initialize the submodules with:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Building

At the root of the repository, run:
```
idf.py build && ./merge_bin.sh ./esp-miner-merged.bin
```

Note: the merge_bin.sh script is a custom script that merges the bootloader, partition table, and the application binary into a single file.

Note: if using VSCode, you may have to configure the settings.json file to match your esp hardware version. For example, if your bitaxe has something other than an esp32-s3, you will need to change the version in the `.vscode/settings.json` file.

### Flashing

With the bitaxe connected to your computer via USB, run:

```
bitaxetool --config ./configs/config-xxx.csv --firmware ./esp-miner-merged.bin
```

where xxx is the config file for your hardware version. You can see the list of available config files in the `configs` directory.

A custom board version is also possible with `configs/config-custom.csv`. A custom board needs to be based on an existing `devicemodel` and `asicmodel`.

**Notes:** 
  - If you are developing within a dev container, you will need to run the bitaxetool command from outside the container. Otherwise, you will get an error about the device not being found.
  - Some Bitaxe versions can't directly connect to a USB-C port. If yours is affected use a USB-A adapter as a workaround. More about it [here](https://github.com/bitaxeorg/bitaxeGamma/issues/37).
  - Only ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module type N16R8 (16MB Flash, 8MB Octal SPI PSRAM) is supported. This model number should be visible on the ESP32 module. Other module types without PSRAM or with Quad SPI PSRAM will not work with the normal firmware. More about it [here](https://github.com/bitaxeorg/ESP-Miner/issues/826).

### Wi-Fi routers

There are some Wi-Fi routers that will block mining, ASUS Wi-Fi routers & some TP-Link Wi-Fi routers for example.
If you find that your not able to mine / have no hash rate you will need to check the Wi-Fi routers settings and disable the following;

1/ AiProtection

2/ IoT 

If your Wi-Fi router has both of these options you might have to disable them both.

If your still having problems here, check other settings within the Wi-Fi router and the bitaxe device, this includes the URL for
the Stratum Host and Stratum Port.
